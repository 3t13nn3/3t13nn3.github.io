Hey there!

I am Etienne PENAULT. I am a final year student in computer science at Sorbonne University. My specialties are AI, Optimisation and Human-Machine Interface. I am *FOSS* enthusiast.

In this section, you will know my life.

You can find my CV (in French) made with Lua\\(\LaTeX\\) [here](./CV.pdf).

## Who am I ?

Born at the end of 1997, I have lived all my life in the Paris suburbs. Since I was little, I have always been immersed in the world of computers and technology in general. I still remember our old computer under *Windows 98* not far from our *Super Nintendo* when I was around 4 years old.

Quite naturally, this attraction to these areas has persisted to the present. I always tried to understand as much as possible the things I was using. Sometimes even modifying them. I was really into tweaking video game consoles, whether it was software or even hardware since the *GameCube*.

In addition, at the same time, I started to write my first lines of code by myself when I was in high school. It was really very basic stuff like:
* A website with `HTML` and `CSS` (which I don't really consider as code)
* Editing Minecraft game code to add new blocks by inheriting existing classes. So in `Java` but everyone makes mistakes right? :flushed: (I was 14 years old, young and innocent...)


## Academic Background

### High School

My school career was not the easiest. I never liked school. I find the French school system really bad. Not because of what we are taught, but more because of the way we are taught... By this, I never made any effort until my higher education, which resulted in more than average grades.

However, in my last year of high school, I have been able to take the Computer Science option where I got the best grade possible (which strangely contrasted with all my other grades at this time). This is where I started to really code. The structure of the course was really nice, a lot of independence and freedom on the tasks to do. It was a real change from other courses that were too academic for anything. That's where I started to learn `C` and `Python`. With my group, we developed a Space Invaders game in `C` with the `SDL` lib, that was a good first experience.

### Higher Education
#### First step in the world of higher education
For my graduate studies, I was initially in a program of mathematics and computer science applied to the humanities and social sciences. Particular experience, very good grades in computer science, very bad in marketing. This is where I realized that I was a science guy. Marketing and communications is one of the things I hate most in life. Giving a fake image of something to trick people, I'm not into that and will never understand how you can love that.

#### License
Now I'm going to talk about the university program that I followed in order to obtain my Bachelor's degree *<u>with high honors</u>*: [The Computer Science License of Paris 8 University](https://informatique.up8.edu/licence-iv/).

I had the chance to study there for 3 great years. I owe a lot of my computer knowledge to this education and to the teachers who taught there. I recommend this place for all computer enthusiasts and people who like to code. I coded and learned a lot. Moreover, it is also here that I was introduced to open source software and its philosophy.

Here is a small list of what I learned there:
* Use a `Linux` based system, understand how it works and its many advantages. (How could you code without a *Unix-like* system? :flushed:)
* Advanced algorithms in a general way like *Dijkstra*, *Tries*, *Compressions algorithmes*...
* AI basics things like *K-Means*, *MinMax*, *NN*...
* Concurrent programming.
* Graphic programming with `OpenGL`.
* Networking programming.
* That `C++` is the most powerful language (it starts to change with the expansion of `Rust`).
* That using \\(\LaTeX\\) is a good thing (guess my thought about *Microsoft Office*...).
* A bunch of different languages.

##### *<u>SWERC:</u>*
At this time I had the chance to participate in the [SWERC - ICPC programming contest](https://swerc.eu/2020/about/) which is quite prestigious. We finished *<u>69th</u>* by coming without a notebook and without preparation. In hindsight, if we had prepared in advance, we could have easily aimed for a place below 30th. 69th place in these conditions, not bad isn't it?

#### Master
Currently, I am in the [ANDROIDE Master at Sorbonne University](https://sciences.sorbonne-universite.fr/formation-sciences/masters/master-informatique/parcours-androide) but I don't take classes there anymore because I'm doing my end of study internship. Compared to my Bachelor's degree, this Master's degree is very theoretical.

I am studying different fields there:
* Operational Research using solver like *CPlex or Gurobi*
* Combinatorial Optimisation for *NP-Hard* problems
* AI, in particular *Reinforcement Learning*, *Supervised Learning*, *Evolutionary Algorithms*...
* Human-Machine Interface (How to model a user and adapt things to it?)

## What I like in everyday life
When I'm away from the keyboard, I keep myself busy in different ways:

- Being a huge music fan, I sometimes spend hours listening to music without doing anything else, just enjoying the sound. I also play guitar sometimes, as I've been playing for 10 years.

- Being quite sporty by nature, I also practiced running in order to prepare the half marathon of Paris.

- Enjoy playing video games (especially old ones).

- Hang out with my friends.
